// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

You'll explore how to use Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS) to drive your
RESTful web service on Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use hypermedia to create a specific style of a response JSON, which has contents
that you can use to navigate your REST service. You'll build on top of a simple inventory
REST service that you can develop with MicroProfile technologies. You can find the service at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
```

The service responds with a JSON file that contains an array of registered hosts. Each host has a collection
of HATEOAS links:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "hostname": "foo",
    "_links": [
      {
        "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/foo",
        "rel": "self"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "hostname": "bar",
    "_links": [
      {
        "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/bar",
        "rel": "self"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
  "hostname": "*",
  "_links": [
    {
      "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/*",
      "rel": "self"
    }
  ]
  }
]
----

=== What is HATEOAS?

HATEOAS is a constrained form of REST application architecture.
With HATEOAS, the client receives information about the available resources from the REST application.
The client does not need to be hardcoded to a fixed set of resources, and the application
and client can evolve independently. In other words, the application tells the client where it can go
and what it can access by providing it with a simple collection of links to other available resources.

=== Response JSON

When you build a RESTful web service, consider the style of your response files.
Whether they are JSON files, XML files, or in some other format, a good practice is to always have them in
a clean and organized form. In the context of HATEOAS, each resource must contain a link reference to
itself, commonly referred to as `self`. Each link also needs a relationship to be associated with it,
although no strict rules exist as to how you need to format this relationship. Contain the collection
of such links within a `_links` array, which itself must be a direct property of the
resource object. The underscore in the `_links` property is used so that the property does not collide with any
existing fields that are named `links`. In this guide, you will use the following structure of HATEOAS links:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  "_links": [
    {
      "href": ,
      "rel":
    }
  ]
----

==== Link types

The following example shows two different links. The first link has a `self` relationship with the
resource object and is generated whenever you register a host. The link points to that host
entry in the inventory:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  {
    "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>",
    "rel": "self"
  }
----

The second link has a `properties` relationship with the resource object and is generated
if the host `system` service is running. The link points to the properties resource on the host:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  {
    "href": "http://<hostname>:9080/system/properties",
    "rel": "properties"
  }
----

==== Other formats

Although you should stick to the previous format for the purpose of this guide, another common
convention has the link as the value of the relationship:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  "_links": {
      "self": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>",
      "properties": "http://<hostname>:9080/system/properties"
  }
----

After the server runs, you can find your hypermedia-driven `inventory` service at the following URL:

* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts[^]

== Creating the response JSON

Navigate to the `start` directory.

[role=command]
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

Begin by building your response JSON, which is composed of the `_links` array and the name of
the host machine.

=== Linking to inventory contents

As mentioned before, your starting point is an existing simple inventory REST service. 

Take a look at the `request handlers` in the [hotspot file=0]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java` file.

InventoryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[]
----

Since the `.../inventory/hosts/`
URL will no longer respond with a JSON representation of the contents of your inventory, you can discard the `listContents`
method and integrate it into the [hotspot=PropertiesForHost file=0]`getPropertiesForHost` method.

[role="code_command hotspot" subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java`
----

The contents of your inventory are now under the asterisk (\*) wildcard and reside at the following URL:
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/*[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/*^]


The [hotspot=handler file=0]`GET` request handler is responsible for handling all [hotspot=handler file=0]`GET` requests that are
made to the target URL. This method responds with a JSON that contains HATEOAS links.

The [hotspot=UriInfo file=0]`UriInfo` object is what is used to build your HATEOAS links.

The [hotspot=Context file=0]`@Context` annotation is a part of CDI and indicates that the `UriInfo` will be injected when the
resource is instantiated.

Your new [hotspot=InventoryResource file=0]`InventoryResource` class is now replaced. Next, let's implement the [hotspot=getSystems file=1]`getSystems` method and build
the response JSON object.

InventoryManager.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[]
----

=== Linking to each available resource

Take a look at your [hotspot file=0]`InventoryManager` and [hotspot file=1]`InventoryUtil` files.

[role="code_command hotspot" subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryManager` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java`
----

InventoryManager.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[]
----

The [hotspot=getSystems file=0]`getSystems` method accepts a
target URL as an argument and returns a JSON object that contains HATEOAS links.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryUtil` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util/InventoryUtil.java`
----

InventoryUtil.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util/InventoryUtil.java[]
----

The [hotspot=buildHostJson file=1]`buildHostJson` helper method builds in the [hotspot file=1]`InventoryUtil` class. It
creates a JSON object that contains the [hotspot=hostname file=1]`hostname` of your system and the [hotspot=links file=1]`_links` array, 
which is generated separately in the [hotspot=buildLinksForHost file=1]`buildLinksForHost` helper method.

This helper accepts a hostname and a target URL as arguments. The helper builds a link that points to the
inventory entry with a [hotspot=self file=1]`self` relationship and also builds a link that points to the `system` service with
a [hotspot=properties file=1]`properties` relationship:

* \http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>
* \http://<hostname>:9080/system/properties

=== Linking to inactive services or unavailable resources
InventoryUtil.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util/InventoryUtil.java[]
----

Consider what happens when one of the return links does not work or when a link should be available
for one object but not for another. In other words, it is important that a resource or service is
available and running before it is linked in the `_links` array.

Although this guide does not cover this case, always make sure that you receive
a good response code from a service before you link that service. Similarly, make sure that
it makes sense for a particular object to access a resource it is linked to. For instance, it doesn't
make sense for an account holder to be able to withdraw money from their account when their balance is 0.
Hence, the account holder should not be linked to a resource that provides money withdrawal.

[role=command]
include::{common-includes}/devmode-build.adoc[]

After the server updates, you can find your new hypermedia-driven `inventory` service at the following URL:

* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts^]


// =================================================================================================
// Testing
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the hypermedia-driven RESTful web service

At the following URLs, access the `inventory` service that is now driven by hypermedia:

* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts^]
* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/localhost[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/localhost^]

The first URL returns the current contents of the inventory, and the second URL returns the system properties for
`localhost`. If the inventory does not contain an entry for the host name that is specified in the URL, which is
`localhost` in this case,
the `system` service that is running on the requested host name is called instead. The system
properties are retrieved from that `system` service and then stored in the inventory and returned.

If the servers are running, you can point your browser to each of the previous URLs to test the
application manually. Nevertheless, you should rely on automated tests since they are more reliable
and trigger a failure if a change introduces a defect.

=== Setting up your tests

EndpointIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=comment']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/hateoas/EndpointIT.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot" subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `EndpointIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/hateoas/EndpointIT.java`
----

You can use the [hotspot=Before]`@BeforeEach` and [hotspot=After]`@AfterEach` annotations to perform any setup and teardown tasks for each
of your individual tests.

=== Writing the tests

Each test method must be marked with the [hotspot=Test1 hotspot=Test2]`@Test` annotation. The execution order of test methods
is controlled by marking them with the [hotspot=Order1 hotspot=Order2]`@Order` annotation. The value that is passed into the annotation
denotes the order in which the methods are run.

The test class contains three helper methods and two test methods:

The [hotspot=getResponse]`getResponse` helper method reuses the same line of code for retrieving a response from a
specific URL. This technique helps keep your code neat and organized.

The [hotspot=assertResponse]`assertResponse` helper method ensures that the response that you receive is
valid, with a `200` response code.

The [hotspot=visitLocalhost]`visitLocalhost` method creates a [hotspot=targetResponse]`GET` request to the
`system` service, which registers the `localhost` system.

The [hotspot=testLinkForInventoryContents]`testLinkForInventoryContents` test is responsible for asserting that
the correct HATEOAS link is created for the inventory contents.

Finally, the [hotspot=testLinksForSystem]`testLinksForSystem` test is responsible for asserting that the correct
HATEOAS links are created for the `localhost` system. This method checks for both the `self` link that points
to the `inventory` service and the `properties` link that points to the `system` service, which is running on the
`localhost` system.
